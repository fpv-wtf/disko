<link>/forum_func=view&amp;id=568&amp;catid=8</link>
<description>Hi all,

I need some absolute positioned elements that can receive select, focus and click events. As far as I know, only windows can be positioned absolutely, but they can't receive those events. Sure, I could define some widget within the windows, but that's not a nice and furthermore a memory wasting solution. Is there another way and I just don't see it?

BTW: How are focus events thrown by mouse usage? I know that buttonpress means select and buttonrelease click, but I can't see the point a focus e...</description>

<description>Hello neeohw,

that's hard to describe in general. Maybe you can explain what you want to achieve in more detail. If you could attach some example code, it would be even better.

Do you want to have a menu and when you click on one item another menu is displayed?
Then your approach by using childwindows is reasonable. In the onClick handler of the first menu you call show() on the childwindow containing the other menu. We are using this method a lot.

As I said, when you describe your idea more detai...</description>

<description>Hello neeohw,

you don't have to feel sorry, we're always happy to help ;-)

There are different ways to set the duration of a popup window.
First via xml-Files:
- You can set it directly inside the dialog file where you define the popupwindow
  as an attribute like this: [code][/code]
- Or more generally in your theme.xml: 
[code]

[/code]
  and then use it inside the dialog file: [code][/code].

Another possibility is to use the API to set it dynamically inside your C++ code:
[code]this-&gt;po...</description>
